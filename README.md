a. First clone the repository
   Move the the directory and run npm install command to install the dependencies.
   Run the npm start command to start the app.


b. Things I think I did well :

I think I did the routing part of the task well by using the React Router library. This avoided the page from refrehing needlessly.

I think did a good job of replicating the design that that was provided. I utilized the Semantic UI CSS library

I managed the state using Context and Hooks instead of Redux. I think it makes the code simple to understand.

I think I incorporated the Infinte scrolling component well.


c. Things I could have done better :

The state of the data is not persistent. If the page is refreshed, the current state is lost.

When doing consecutive searches without refreshing, the results of the searches appear below the previous results I tried to fix it but it caused some issues. Maybe I could have done better.

I could not find the name of the director, the actors and the movie length in the API response. So I could not display them in the Details page.
